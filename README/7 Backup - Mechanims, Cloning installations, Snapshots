. Backup and Restore
--------------------

Besides BTRFS snapshots (which are not a choice for backup or archiving)
centaurisoho provides integrated backup and restore. The main idea is to
have data-less clients, e.g. to keep backup/archive data on the primary
server and to mirror the primary server to external disk or a secondary
server. It is also supported to use extarnal backup disk to mirror (and
deduplicate) data from multiple computers.


. Disks and Partitioning
------------------------  

centaurisoho prefers BTRFS but does not depend on it. For example 32bit
Raspberry Pis will use ext4. With BTRFS comes the concept of subvolumes
and snapshots. While BTRFS is not the fastest filesystem, it has proven
reliability and detects bit-rot. Data deduplication is another goodie.

[[Partions]] are used by [[label]], not by [[device]] paths or UIDS. Labels are made
of hostname and volume id:
        
        <hostname>_<volume>

Default volumes or partitions:

        boot        1st disk, (EFI) boot partition
        swap        1st disk, swap space (optional)
        vol0        1st disk BTRFS volume
        vol1        2nd disk BTRFS volume
        root        non BTRFS system only: root file system 
        windows
        mirror      server only: (external disk) mirrored volumes

BTRFS sub volumes:

        root        root file system without /home
        home        user home folders
        export
        shared      shared data
        backup      backup/archive data
        vbox        for virtual box
        archive     server only: system data archive
        history     server only: backup archive

The tools centaurimedia and centauridisk are used to create ...
        

. Hierarchie, Mount points
--------------------------

        /
        /home
        /export
        /network
        /shared
    
        /mnt/backup
        /mnt/boot
        /mnt/vbox
        /mnt/vol0
        /mnt/vol1
        /mnt/windows

By default only / and /home are mounted via '/etc/fstab'. The preferred
way to mount volumes is centaurimounter.


. Terminology and tools
-----------------------

    backup          compressed tar file. Usually for volumes/partitions
                    boot/root/usr/home/shared/data. The low level tools
                    are centauribackup and centaurirestore. To control
                    what (volatile) data can be excluded from backup
                    the centauribackup tool is scriptable.

    archive         backups that are designed to be kept in a timeline
                    for long time storage.

    timeline        all snapshots/backups and archives can be orginized 
                    by day/week/month/quarter/year to build a history of
                    data. This is implemented in centauriarchive and is
                    used by centauridata and centaurisnapshot.

    snapshots       created manually or by centauricron. By default a
                    day/week/month timeline with 10/60/120 days before
                    automatic exoiration.

    system data

    user data       Users should have their home folder either directly
                    on the server or should synchronize data using the
                    unison or centauricopy tools. User data should not
                    completely part of system backups, see centauribackup.

    shared data     Data that does not belong  to the system or particular
                    users.    


. physical backups (system data)
--------------------------------

    centauridata  disks
    centauridata  purge


. logical backups (user/shared data)
------------------------------------

    centauridata  data


. mirroring (most data)
-----------------------

    centaurimirror


. Low level: centauribackup
---------------------------

    centauribackup  <what>
