. Appliances
============

A machine that boots into a state were it fullfills some special purpose, usually without
human interaction is called an appliance. Centauri-Soho support the following:

    Networking Boot Menu
    --------------------

        Allows to switch between Network modes at boot time. Can start a desktop session.
        Nice for testing.

    Router
    ------

        Connects two Networks using NAT. Provides DNS and DHCP services. The default
        configuration joins ethernet and wireless into an internal network and uses
        mobile phone tethering via USB to connect to the internet.

    Repeater
    --------

        A router configuration where an external net is connected via wireless and an
        internal net is provided by ethernet. This uses NAT, so from the internal net
        one can reach the extern net but not the other way round.

    Autologin
    ---------

The 'Network Boot Menu', 'Kiosk' and 'HomeAssistant' appliances use the kernel command line
parameter 'centaurilogin=<user>'. This causes the following to be run (abbreviated):

        centaurautologin@<user>             # service triggered by 'centaurilogin=<user>'
        centaurisession autoloin <user> 6   # called by centaurautologin
        agetty --autologin <user> tty6      # login, run bash
        /home/<user>/.autologin             # executed by bash profile
        centauristartup menu                # see below ...

The '.autologin' is optional but usually a symlink to 'centauristartup'


    Configuration
