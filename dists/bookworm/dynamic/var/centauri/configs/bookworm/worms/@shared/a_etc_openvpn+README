This folder contains OpenVPN configurations for Centauri-SOHO linux. The
files 'server.conf' and 'client.conf' are installed from the repository
and usually don't need modifications.

Server OpenVPN configuration:

    The 'server/<domain>/server.conf' file refers to the following files
    that must be installed in 'server/<domain>' (symlinks are ok):

    ca.crt          # certificate authority, see centauricerts
    crl.pem         # certificate revokation list
    dh.pem          # diffie hellman parameters
    server.crt      # server certificate
    server.key
    ta.key          # transport authority (a 128 bit random number)
    updown          # script to configure network, see centauriswitch

    All files can be generated and installed using 'centauricerts'. And
    'server.conf' should be symlinked to '/etc/openvpn'. So this server
    can be started via systemd: 'systemctl start openvpn@server'.

Client configuration:

    The 'client/<domain>/client.conf' file refers to the following files:

    ca.crt          # certificate authority, see centauricerts
    client.crt      # client certificate
    client.key
    ta.key          # transport authority (a 128 bit random number)

    These files can be generated and exported using 'cetauricerts'. Export
    generates a tar file that can be extracted into 'client/<domain>'. The
    'client.conf' (but not 'app-client.conf') should be symlinked to the
    '/etc/openvpn' folder. So 'openvpn --config /etc/openvpn/client.conf'
    can start an OpenVPN client instance.

    Usually NetworkManager is used to start OpenVPN clients. The repository
    contains 'OpenVPN-Centauri.nmconnection' to add a NM system connection.
