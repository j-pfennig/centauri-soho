# Sample configuration file for smartd.  See man smartd.conf.

# Home page is: http://smartmontools.sourceforge.net

# smartd will re-read the configuration file if it receives a HUP
# signal

# The file gives a list of devices to monitor using smartd, with one
# device per line. Text after a hash (#) is ignored, and you may use
# spaces and tabs for white space. You may use '\' to continue lines.

# You can usually identify which hard disks are on your system by
# looking in /proc/ide and in /proc/scsi.

# The word DEVICESCAN will cause any remaining lines in this
# configuration file to be ignored:
DEVICESCAN -d removable -n standby -m root -M exec /usr/share/smartmontools/smartd-runner

# This is for centaurismart
/dev/sda -a -m root
/dev/sdb -a -m root -d removable
/dev/sdc -a -m root -d removable
/dev/sdd -a -m root -d removable
/dev/nvme0n1 -a -m root -d removable
