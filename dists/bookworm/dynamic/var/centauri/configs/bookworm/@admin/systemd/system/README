CONTENTS of the the system or user folders
==========================================

1. service, timer and target systemd unit files

   These are real units that can be symlinked to /etc/systemd/(system|user).
   This can be done manually via 'systemctl enable' or via configuration
   entries in $CEN_ROOT/default/centauri-bash-lib and --info setup.

    TODO: unlink a service

2.  <unit>.override files

    These contain 'override.conf' data for the <unit>. The --info setup
    symlinks them to /etc/systemd/(system|user)/<unit>.d/override.conf
    (.d folders are created if neccessary).

    Instead using 1. to replace an otherwise existing unit, it is often
    wiser to 'patch' these units via overrides.

3.  <unit>.wants files

    The files contain lists to 'hack' systemd Wants= or WantedBy= statements.
    The --info setup can create or remove symlinks in /etc/..../<unit>.wants
    folders. This is a bit ugly but can save writing a lot of override files.


Disabling service autostarts
============================

In centauri some runlevels/targets to service associations are modified.
This could be done in one of 5 ways:

1. create a private service file in /etc/systemd/system
2. override WantedBy= and Wants= directives using *.override files
3. enable/disable services manually via 'systemctl'
4. crafting the /etc/systemd/system/*.wants via *.wants files
5. using vendor defaults
6. using 'centaurirunvel script'

Methods 1 and 2 are permanent, e.g. are not globally invalidated when
restoring defaults via 'systemctl'.

Method 3 is completely volatile and cannot be restored automatically.

Method 4 is volatile but can be restored by 'centrauricreate --info install'.

Method 5 is works only at installation time of services or with 'systemctl'.

Method 6 is fine for the initial configuration of a new installation

For most cases in centauri method 4 (*.wants) is used.


Services that should not start by default
=========================================

In centauri SysV run-levels are revived by reconfiguring system services.
A helper service is used to start some network services (run-level >= 3):

centauri-network.service:
    gmediarender.service 
    inetd.service
    minidlna.service 
    networking.service 

There are 5 targets used by centauriswitch (some kind of network location
awareness) to manage network-state dependent services:

centauri-master.target:                     # the current master server
      centauri-network.service
      centauriswitch.service 
      centauriwsdd.service
    * cyrus-imapd.service 
    * dnsmasq.service 
    * exim4.service 
      network-online.target 
      nfs-mountd.service
      nfs-server.service
    * ntpsec.service
    * openvpn@server.service
      rpcbind.service

centauri-slave.target:                      # the current slave server
      centauri-network.service
      centauriswitch.service 
      centauriwsdd.service
    * dnsmasq.service 
      network-online.target 
      winbind.service 
      nfs-mountd.service
      nfs-server.service 
      rpcbind.service

centauri-member.target:                     # any domain member computer
    centauri-network.service
    centauriswitch.service 
    centauriwsdd.service 
    network-online.target
    nfs-mountd.service 
    nmbd.service
    rpcbind.service
    smbd.service 
    winbind.service 

centauri-public.target:                     # in a public network
    network-online.target
    centauriswitch.service

centauri-trusted.target:                    # in a trusted network
    centauriswitch.service
    centauri-network.service
    centauriwsdd.service
    network-online.target
    nmbd.service
    smbd.service
    winbind.service


The following are started explicitly via 'centauriswitch':

   samba-ad-dc cups cyrus-imapd exim4 ntp openvpn 
   nfs-server

Some services are started via 'inetd' or 'cron':

   rsync ssh smbd saned vsftpd
   fetchmail smartmontools

Corresponding entries are added to runlevel *.wants files.


SysV Legacy
===========

See 'centaurirunlevel' and /etc/default/centaurirunlevel


Location Awareness (run by centauriswitch)
==========================================

Helpers:
    centauri-sysinit.service    early inits, started by sysinit.target

    centauri-netconf.service    Check IPv6 and HTTP-Proxy Connectivity
    centauri-network.service    Starts minimal networks services

Only one of these can be active:

    centauri-master.target  centauri-network    -
    centauri-slave.target   centauri-network    -
    centauri-member.target  centauri-network    centauri-netconf
    centauri-trusted.target centauri-network    centauri-netconf
    centauri-public.target  CONFLICTS           -

Remarks:


    runlevel2:  - centaurisysinit can start appliances and if so
                  it also starts networking.target and inetd.service
    runlevel3:  - centaurisysinit can start appliances
                - centauriroute is started

    Centauriswitch is not started below runlevel4. In all runlevels
    some services are started via /etc/default/centauriswitch
