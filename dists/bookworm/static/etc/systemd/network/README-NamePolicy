This is about systemd vs bios interface naming ...

1st: centaurisoho can handle both policies, but these code paths are not so
     well testet yet.

The NamePolicy can be set by kernel, udev or systemd. The only reliable way to
turn stable interface names off is the kernel boot parameter 'net.ifnames=0'.

Raspberry Pi Os for example mixes udev and systemd rules to make the onboard
ethernet interface appear as 'end0' and the wlan interfaces as 'wlan0'. So the
often mentioned '99-default-rules.link' to '/dev/null' does not work as expec-
ted.

This is why centaurisoho uses the kernel boot parameter. The boot commands are
autogenerated, see centaurinetcfg 'option sysdnames'.
